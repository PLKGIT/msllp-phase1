    <h1>Firm Profile</h1>

    EXCEPTIONAL EXPERIENCE = EXCEPTIONAL RESULTS Since 2005 when McMahon Law
    Group and the Law Offices of David M. Serepca merged to form McMahon Serepca
    LLP (MSLLP), our firm has represented a diverse set of clients ranging from
    sophisticated individuals to multi-billion dollar public companies in their
    most challenging litigation and corporate matters. We have an exceptional
    record of success because our practice areas are led by experienced
    attorneys who spent the first decade of their careers learning their
    respective specialties at among the most prestigious law firms in the world.
    We are committed to providing exceptional legal service. Where we separate
    ourselves from the large law firms from which we came is that because we are
    a boutique sized firm we are able to provide much more personal attention to
    the needs of our clients at half the cost. We believe that attorneys should
    be accessible, responsive, and we are dedicated to distinguishing our legal
    representation from all other firms. Corporate Practice We offer a
    full-service corporate and transactional practice and regularly represent
    clients across a broad spectrum of business matters in which we have
    extensive experience. We represent all categories of participants in
    transactions, including buyers, sellers, major stockholders, lenders,
    financial advisors, management, special board committees, venture
    capitalists, individual investors, private equity funds, and others. Mergers
