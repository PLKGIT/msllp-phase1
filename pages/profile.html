          <h4>EXCEPTIONAL EXPERIENCE = EXCEPTIONAL RESULTS</h4>
          <p>Since 2005 when McMahon Law Group and the Law Offices of David M. Serepca merged to form McMahon Serepca LLP (MSLLP), our firm has represented a diverse set of clients ranging from sophisticated individuals to multi-billion dollar public companies in their most challenging litigation and corporate matters.  We have an exceptional record of success because our practice areas are led by experienced attorneys who spent the first decade of their careers learning their respective specialties at among the most prestigious law firms in the world.  </p>
          <p>We are committed to providing exceptional legal service. Where we separate ourselves from the large law firms from which we came is that because we are a boutique sized firm we are able to provide much more personal attention to the needs of our clients at half the cost.  We believe that attorneys should be accessible, responsive, and we are dedicated to distinguishing our legal representation from all other firms.</p>
          <h4>Corporate Practice</h4>
          <p>We offer a full-service corporate and transactional practice and regularly represent clients across a broad spectrum of business matters in which we have extensive experience.  We represent all categories of participants in transactions, including buyers, sellers, major stockholders, lenders, financial advisors, management, special board committees, venture capitalists, individual investors, private equity funds, and others. </p>

          <h4>Litigation Practice</h4>
          <p>The primary focus of our litigation practice is defense-side cost-effective representation.  Our trial teams have achieved exceptional results, including multiple defense verdicts, summary judgments, and extraordinary injunctive relief. We also provide strategic counseling on all matters relating to how to best prepare for litigation and/or achieve successful pre-litigation settlements.  We are known for our aggressive ethical advocacy. </p>
